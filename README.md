# Restaurant

This is a project based off of the iOS Data Collections book. I am implementing some key features that differentiate it from the assignement on the book.
 
#Key Differences: 
 - the UI is created programmatically using UIkit instead of storyboards
 - replaces the categories tableview with a collectionview. 
 - extends the adding to cart functionality. Before the user would only be able to add one of the same product. 
 - receipt extention
  -  receipt now shows the products that were purchased.
