# Restaurant

This is a project based off of the restaurant assingment from the iOS Data Collections book. I am implementing some key features that differentiate it from the assignement on the book.
 
 # Currenly working on: 
 - displaying on fetching the products and displayin them on the collectionview. 

 
# Key Differences: 
 - the UI is created programmatically using UIkit instead of storyboards
 - replaces the categories tableview with a collectionview. 
 - extends the adding to cart functionality. Before the user would only be able to add one of the same product. 
 - receipt extension by showing products that were chosen.
